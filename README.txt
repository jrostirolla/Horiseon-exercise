Horiseon-exercise

I refactored the Horiseon website to improve the existing code and bring it up to semantic standards.
After reviewing the original code, I went through and added semantic labelling to each of the sections in the code, to better show where the images, the articles, and the header/footer are. Through this, I learnt the importance of proper labelling for the flow of code analysing and maintanence.
